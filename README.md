# Plutus HR System — Frontend

Next.js (App Router) frontend for [`plutus-hr-system`](https://github.com/oghenenoghie/plutus-hr-system), the FastAPI backend for Plutus Technologies' compliance-native payroll and HR platform.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, TypeScript, client-rendered auth/data — no server-side session)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**, themed with the "Ledger" design system (see `src/app/globals.css`)
- **Manrope** via `next/font/google`
- Plain `fetch` against the FastAPI backend — no data-fetching library

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # point NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL at your backend
npm run dev
```

The app expects `plutus-hr-system` running locally (default `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`) with at least one seeded `Account` + `Membership` to sign in with. To preview the UI without a backend at all, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE=1` in `.env.local` — every screen renders from `src/lib/api/mock-fixtures.ts` and skips login entirely.

## Structure

```
src/
  app/
    login/               sign-in screen
    (app)/                admin/manager shell: sidebar nav + dashboard, employees,
                          payroll, leave, expenses, loans, benefits, contractors,
                          reports, settlement, simulation
    me/                   employee self-service surface (single page, no admin nav)
  components/
    layout/               Sidebar, TopBar, PageHeader
    ui/                   Card, Badge, Button, Input, Table, KpiTile, Avatar, ...
    employee-picker.tsx   shared employee <select> used by benefits/settlement/simulation
  lib/
    api/                  apiFetch client (token refresh, 401 handling) + typed endpoints
    auth/                 token storage, AuthProvider/useAuth, route AuthGate
    types.ts              TypeScript mirror of the backend's Pydantic schemas
    format.ts             ₦ currency formatting (whole naira, en-NG), dates, initials
    nav.ts                role → nav item mapping
```

## Auth model

The backend issues JWT access/refresh token pairs from `POST /auth/login` (no cookies). This app:

1. Stores both tokens in `localStorage` (`src/lib/auth/token-store.ts`).
2. Attaches `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` to every request.
3. On a `401`, transparently calls `POST /auth/refresh` once and retries; if that fails, clears the session and redirects to `/login`.

Roles are `admin`, `payroll_manager`, `manager`, `employee` (from `GET /auth/me`). Admin/payroll_manager/manager land in the sidebar shell at `/dashboard`; `employee` lands on the single-surface self-service page at `/me`. `AuthGate` (`src/lib/auth/auth-gate.tsx`) enforces this client-side — the real authorization boundary is the backend's RLS + `require_roles`, not this nav filter.

## Design system

Colors, type scale, spacing and component patterns follow Plutus's "Ledger" design system — flat, bordered, institutional, no shadows, whole-naira currency. Tokens live as CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css` and are exposed to Tailwind via `@theme inline` (`bg-primary`, `text-good`, `rounded-card`, etc.).

## What's scaffolded vs. stubbed

Every backend list/read endpoint is wired up and rendering real data. Write actions are wired where they're a single click (leave/expense approvals, statutory filing/remittance, benefit lookups). Multi-field create forms (new employee, new pay run, new loan/expense/benefit application) are **not** built yet — that's the natural next slice of work on top of this scaffold.
