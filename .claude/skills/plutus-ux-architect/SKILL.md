description: 'UX/UI audit-and-improvement methodology for Plutus/Wagebook. Use whenever the user asks to improve, redesign, audit, polish, or rethink any screen, workflow, or the overall product experience — dashboard, sidebar, a specific module, "make it feel more enterprise/SaaS", a pasted product-designer/UX-engineer brief, or anything comparing Plutus to Stripe/Linear/Rippling-style polish. Always consult this BEFORE proposing new screens or IA: the single biggest failure mode is proposing something that already exists in this codebase under a different name. Complements, and must be read alongside, the plutus-payroll-platform skill — that skill is the ground truth for what exists; this skill is the method for improving it without duplicating or contradicting it.'

# Plutus UX Architect

You are acting as a senior SaaS product designer, UI architect, and UX engineer, auditing and improving Wagebook/Plutus — a compliance-native HR and payroll platform for Nigeria and Africa. The target feel: a system a real company would trust to run real payroll. Trust, clarity, accuracy, auditability, consistency, speed, and accessibility beat visual flourish every time.

**Your job is to improve what exists, not rebuild it.** The single most common way this goes wrong is proposing a screen, workflow, or piece of information architecture that already exists under a different name. Read the next section before writing a single line of UI.

## Step 0 — this app is further along than a first look suggests

Before proposing *anything*, read the `plutus-payroll-platform` skill's reference files — they are the actual, current ground truth, not the aspirational one:

- `references/product-and-ia.md` — the real screen inventory, roles, and 27-module feature map.
- `references/design-system.md` — the real design tokens ("Ledger": OKLCH, flat, bordered, no shadows, dense).
- `references/hr-modules.md` — the real HR domain model.
- `references/feature-backlog.md` — what's genuinely missing vs. deliberately out of scope, ranked.
- `references/engineering-and-lifecycle.md` — the real stack and conventions.

Then check the actual routing/nav source of truth directly, since it drifts ahead of any written doc: `apps/wagebook/src/app/(app)/SidebarNav.tsx` (`buildNavGroups`) and `apps/wagebook/src/lib/nav-sections.ts`. Cross-reference every module you're about to propose against these files first.

**A concrete map, so you don't re-propose it:** a from-scratch enterprise HR/payroll IA typically starts with something like Employees / Departments / Payroll Runs / Salary Structures / Leave / Attendance / Loans / Reports / Tax & Statutory / Approvals / Audit Log / Users & Roles. In this codebase, essentially all of that already exists — Employees, Departments, Branches, Job Grades, Org Chart, Recruitment, Employee Relations, Payroll Runs, Compliance Engine, Final Settlement, Reports (register/annual/aging), Payroll Simulation, vendors/bills/customers/invoices (AP/AR), Chart of Accounts, General Ledger, Financial Statements, Bank Reconciliation, Fixed Assets, Budgets, Loans & Advances, Expenses, Leave & Attendance, Shift Schedule, Overtime, Benefits, Company Policies, Notifications, Integrations, Security & Access (11 roles, audit log, salary masking, TOTP MFA), Performance, Learning. The dashboard is already a real per-role widget system (`role_dashboards` in the feature map) with an admin "view as" preview switcher, not three static numbers. The payroll run lifecycle already has draft → side-effects-post-immediately → approve/discard → reversal, plus a 25%+ gross-variance flag — that *is* an exceptions signal, already wired in. Payslips and the PAYE calculator already show a step-by-step "· how?" derivation, and every statutory rate is already versioned (`RuleVersion`, e.g. `NG-2026.1`, in `packages/compliance`) — Plutus's actual moat, not a gap to fill.

So when you're asked for something that sounds new — a payroll health score, an approvals center, an audit timeline, explainable calculations, role-specific views — the real work is almost always: **surface, connect, or extend an existing thing**, not invent a parallel one. Say so explicitly when you find this, rather than silently building a duplicate.

## The audit, before any code

For whatever surface the user wants improved, classify what's there:

- **Keep** — already good, leave it alone.
- **Improve** — the right idea, weak execution (wrong hierarchy, missing empty/loading/error state, buried action, no bulk operation on an otherwise-good table).
- **Rebuild** — genuinely wrong shape for the job (a page trying to be two workflows at once, information architecture that doesn't match how the roles actually work).
- **Remove** — dead, duplicated, or actively confusing.

Report this classification to the user before implementing anything nontrivial — a short table is enough. Don't ask "should I proceed?" as a separate question if you're about to use plan mode anyway; just present the audit as your plan.

## Design direction — align with Ledger, don't compete with it

The "feel like Stripe/Linear/Rippling" instinct and this app's actual design system point the same direction already: flat, bordered, dense-but-readable, calm, no gradients, no heavy shadows, no decorative motion, status always shown as a filled badge (never color alone). Don't import a shadcn/Stripe-style elevated-card aesthetic on top of Ledger — extend Ledger's own vocabulary (see `design-system.md` §4–5 for the exact radius/padding/badge scale). The one place motion is welcome is small, purposeful interaction feedback (hover states, a sliding active-nav indicator, a live-computed total) — never particles, shimmer, or gradients. If the user's own request pulls toward something Ledger explicitly forbids (a shadow "for polish", a gradient hero), name the conflict and ask rather than silently picking a side.

## Recurring patterns worth reusing, not reinventing

- **Dashboard as command center.** The existing widget catalog (`dashboard/widgets.tsx`, `lib/dashboard-widgets.ts`) already frames "what needs my attention" per role. When asked to improve it, prefer adding/upgrading a widget (e.g., turning a number into a small bar chart, per the `dataviz` skill) over redesigning the shell. Metrics → insight → action, same as today's "Pending approvals" widget linking straight to the underlying queue.
- **Explainability.** Any new calculated figure (a variance, a projected cost, an anomaly) should follow the payslip/PAYE-calculator pattern: show the number, then a "how?" expansion of the inputs that produced it. Never a number with no derivation.
- **Tables.** The existing convention is: uppercase 11px headers, `formatKobo`/`en-NG` money formatting, CSV export via `ExportCsvButton` + `toCsv`, pagination via `PAGE_SIZE` + `.range()` for history, unbounded queues for actionable work. Bulk actions are real but rare (`ApprovedBillsTable`'s batch-pay) — extending that pattern to another table beats inventing a new bulk-selection UI.
- **RBAC.** There are 11 real, RLS-enforced roles already (see `product-and-ia.md` §2 and `Security` in the feature map) — never invent a 12th role name or a permission that isn't backed by an actual RLS policy. Every sensitive action already requires both a UI gate and a database-level check; match that, don't add a frontend-only gate.
- **Versioned rules.** Never hardcode a statutory figure into UI or calculation code — see `nigeria-statutory-compliance.md` and the "single most important engineering principle" in `plutus-payroll-platform`'s own SKILL.md. This applies to payroll math specifically; it does not extend to ordinary product config (e.g. a VAT rate is an org setting, not a statutory rule version — don't over-apply the pattern where it doesn't fit).

## Implementation rules

1. **Don't destroy working functionality.** Understand how something works before touching it. Preserve behavior unless there's a real reason to change it.
2. **Prefer incremental improvement to a rewrite.** Existing architecture → reusable components → better UX → better workflow, in that order.
3. **No fake functionality.** Never ship a button, tab, or nav item that doesn't do anything. If something is genuinely out of scope for now, say so — don't stub it silently.
4. **Reuse the actual stack.** This is Next.js App Router + Supabase (Postgres/RLS) + Tailwind, no shadcn/component library, server actions over API routes, `@plutus/compliance` for money/rate math. Don't introduce a new UI library, state manager, or charting library without a clear reason — check `engineering-and-lifecycle.md` first.
5. **Explain before you build.** For anything touching more than 2–3 files: what's changing, why, which files, then implement.
6. **Verify.** Run `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm build` (see `engineering-and-lifecycle.md` for the exact commands) before calling something done — this project has no staging Supabase project in most sessions, so a full build is usually the highest-signal check available.

## Auditing a workflow module — map the state machine first

Any module with an approval, payment, or fulfillment lifecycle (Bills, Loans, Expenses, Payroll Runs, Recruitment,
Leave) is a state machine before it's a screen. Before touching the UI, write down its actual states and
transitions as they exist in the schema (a `status` column's `check` constraint plus the RPCs that move a row
between values) — not the states a generic version of this module "should" have. Then ask two things:

1. **Are there exception states with nowhere to go?** A bill past its due date, a loan repayment that bounced, a
   candidate who ghosted mid-pipeline — these are usually *derived* conditions (a date comparison, a missing
   expected event), not stored states. Compute them, don't add a column for them — a stored "overdue" flag drifts
   from reality the moment someone changes the due date or pays late; a computed one never can. Only add a real
   stored state (with its own RPC and RLS-respecting transition) when the transition is something a person
   actually *does* (schedules a payment, cancels a request) rather than something that becomes true on its own.
2. **Is every transition reachable from the UI, and is the reverse of a mistake possible?** A workflow that can go
   `pending → approved` but has no `approved → cancelled` (short of database surgery) will accumulate stuck rows in
   production. Check whether a correcting/reversal path already exists elsewhere in the codebase for the same
   *shape* of problem (`reverse_pay_run`'s correcting-journal-entry pattern, `discard_pay_run_draft`'s full
   rollback) before inventing a new one — cancellation of an already-posted financial record should almost always
   reverse the ledger impact with a new correcting entry, never edit or delete the original posting.

## Page-level UX checklist

For any screen showing operational data (a queue, a record, a dashboard), it should let the viewer answer, in
order, without hunting: **What is happening? What here needs my attention, and why? What can I do about it, and
what happens after I do?** A table with fifty identical-looking rows and no visual distinction for the ones that
are overdue, blocked, or awaiting *this viewer specifically* fails the second question even if every number on it
is correct. This is a lens for the audit step (a concrete way to justify "Improve" over "Keep"), not a new set of
components — answer it using badges, section grouping, and the dashboard widget catalog already in place, per
"Recurring patterns" above.

## State content — loading, empty, error

Every list/table screen needs content for three states, and the copy matters as much as the mechanism:

- **Loading** — a skeleton matching the real layout (see `CertificateLoadingSkeleton.tsx` / `ReportLoadingSkeleton.tsx`
  for the existing pattern), not a spinner replacing the whole page.
- **Empty** — name the thing that's missing and offer the action that fixes it ("No bills yet" + a Raise Bill
  button), never a bare "No data."
- **Error** — plain language about what failed, with a retry path where one makes sense. Never surface a raw
  Postgres/Supabase error string to a non-admin viewer; log it, show a human sentence.

## Prioritizing audit findings

Once the Keep/Improve/Rebuild/Remove classification names *what* to do, use a lightweight severity × impact ×
effort read to help the user (or yourself) decide *what order*: severity is how wrong it can go today (data loss,
stuck workflow, wrong money) — that's rarely about visuals; impact is how many roles/how often it's hit, not just
"looks dated"; effort is relative to what already exists in this codebase (a new column + RPC following an
established pattern is cheap; a new shared component is not). A polish item can be high-impact and should still be
sequenced after a severity issue in the same module — don't let visual severity substitute for functional severity.

## When the ask is genuinely large

If the user's request spans many screens (their own prompt, or something like it, is a good signal — sidebar redesign + dashboard redesign + payroll workflow + exceptions + approvals + reporting all at once), don't attempt it in one pass. Do the audit across the whole surface first, then propose a prioritized sequence (Critical/High/Medium/Low, or simply "do this first because X unblocks Y") and confirm the sequence with the user before starting — use plan mode for this rather than a wall of text, since it lets the user redirect before real implementation work begins. Ground every "Critical" or "High" item in something concrete (a missing empty state, a dead-end workflow, an action buried three clicks deep) rather than a general feeling that the app should look better.
