## 2. Roles and access control

**Built out to seven roles (2026-07-30/31), up from the original four.** "Admin" now displays as **Super Admin** in every UI label (a rename only — the underlying `admin` role, its RLS, and its DB check-constraint value are unchanged) to match the original prototype's "Admin (Super User)" framing. Three new roles were added for real, each with its own RLS shape, not just a nav filter:

| Role | Permissions | Nav access |
|---|---|---|
| Super Admin (`admin`) | Company setup · All payroll runs · All employees · Reports · Integrations, Billing & Subscription, Approval Workflows, Security | Full nav |
| Payroll Manager | Create/process runs · View employees · Compliance & reports | overview, payroll, compliance, reports, loans, expenses, settlement, calculator, simulation, notifications |
| **Accountant** *(new)* | **Full Payroll Manager parity** — everywhere `payroll_manager` appears in an RLS policy or authorization check (pay runs, ledger, loan/expense/overtime approval, leave encashment, salary-masking bypass), `accountant` was added alongside it. Same MFA requirement as Payroll Manager. | Same as Payroll Manager |
| HR Manager | Employees & onboarding · Leave & attendance · Benefits | overview, setup, employees, attendance, leave, manager, benefits, notifications |
| **Department Manager** *(new)* | Scoped to **one department**, via a new `departments.manager_id` — view that department's employees, approve that department's leave requests. Distinct from the existing generic "reporting manager" concept (`core.is_manager_of()`, keyed off `employees.manager_id`, unaffected by this addition). Assignable only by Super Admin, from the Departments page. | overview, employees (dept-scoped by RLS), org-chart, leave & attendance only — no payroll, company or tools |
| **Auditor** *(new)* | **Strictly read-only, everywhere** — added only to `SELECT` policies, never to `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, across payroll, compliance, and lifecycle-audit tables, including the Security & Access audit log (widened from Super-Admin-only). Salary stays masked for Auditor the same as for HR Manager — read-only access doesn't imply seeing real compensation figures. | Same broad nav as non-admin roles, plus Security & Access (no Integrations, no Billing) |
| Employee | Self-service payslips · Leave requests · Expense claims | Dedicated self-service dashboard only |

The Employee role does not get a filtered admin nav — it gets a distinct self-service surface showing leave balance, TIN status, pension PFA, latest payslip breakdown (gross / PAYE / pension / NHF / net), leave requests, expense claims, loans, and benefits.

**MFA is required for Super Admin, Payroll Manager and Accountant.** This is stated as a product requirement, not a setting.

A **team-invite flow** (Security & Access, Super Admin only) grants any of Super Admin/Payroll Manager/HR Manager/Accountant/Auditor to a new login — deliberately excludes Employee (that self-service invite stays tied to a specific employee record, via the pre-existing `employees/[id]/edit` flow) and Department Manager (granted from the department it heads instead, alongside the `manager_id` assignment, since it only makes sense attached to an existing employee record).

Role separation must be enforced server-side via RLS, not just by hiding nav items. The nav filter is presentation; the security boundary is in the database.

## 3. Setup & onboarding — the three forms

These are the inputs that configure everything else. Getting them right is what makes the compliance engine correct downstream.

**1 · Company & statutory registration** — company name, RC number, company TIN, default pay frequency (monthly / bi-weekly / weekly), default pension PFA, states of operation. Drives which state filing schedules and default PFA appear across the platform.

**2 · Add employee** — full name, role/title, state of residence, annual basic, annual housing, annual transport, TIN, pension PFA, **employee photo**. Every field here feeds TIN gating, PAYE, pension and NHF for that employee. Note the three separate pay components — this is where production replaces the demo's 50/30/20 assumption.

### Employee photo capture (enrollment requirement)

**The photo is uploaded at enrollment, in this form** — not bolted on later through a separate profile-editing flow. Capturing it at the point of onboarding is what makes the HR dashboard, directory and approval queues legible; a directory of initials-only placeholders is the failure state this requirement exists to prevent.

Behaviour:

- Upload sits in the Add-employee form with immediate preview and re-crop before save. Accept drag-drop, file picker, and camera capture on mobile — HR often onboards from a phone.
- Square crop, centred on the face, stored at a single canonical size (512×512 is ample) plus a small thumbnail for tables and avatars.
- **A missing photo must never block a payroll run.** This is the important constraint. TIN is a hard gate because the law requires it; a photo is not. Model the photo as optional-but-prompted: HR sees an outstanding-photo count and can chase it, but a pay run proceeds regardless. Conflating the two gates would mean a missing headshot stops people getting paid, which is an absurd failure mode and exactly the kind of thing that gets built by accident when both are "onboarding completeness" fields.
- **Initials fallback** wherever a photo is absent — the prototype already establishes this pattern with the `FN` monogram in the header. The fallback is permanent, not a loading state; some employees will decline and that must remain workable.
- Employees can replace their own photo from self-service; HR can replace anyone's. Both actions are audit-logged.

Where photos surface: employee directory rows, the self-service preview panel, leave and expense approval queues (a manager approving a request should see who), the manager team view, attendance grid rows, and the signed-in user chip in the header.

**3 · Create pay run** — pay period, frequency (monthly regular / bonus / 13th month / arrears / off-cycle), employee scope (all employees / single department / contractors for WHT). Opens a run against every registered employee; the compliance engine applies statutory rules once processed.

## 4. Screen-level detail worth preserving

**Compliance Engine** — displays the seven schemes as a table of name, base, rate, authority, deadline, alongside the PAYE band table and a TIN registration gating panel that lists unregistered workers by name and state.

**Payroll Runs** — run list with period, employee count, gross, net, status. Selecting a run expands a per-employee payslip table (gross, PAYE, pension 8%, NHF 2.5%, net) with a "· how?" expander per employee that shows the full derivation: component split → statutory deductions → chargeable income → band-by-band PAYE → monthly figure. **That expander is the product's core demonstration** — the claim "correct by construction" is only credible because the arithmetic is visible. Preserve it.

**Reports** — statutory liability by state with per-state filing status against each state IRS, plus a full audit trail.

**PAYE Calculator** — standalone, takes annual gross and annual rent, shows the four-step derivation. Carries the explicit caveat that the 50/30/20 split is an assumption and production reads real components.

**Payroll Simulation** — org-wide raise slider showing before/after annual gross payroll, annual org PAYE, and employer pension at 10%. The point is showing statutory cost impact *before* committing.

**Final Settlement** — exit payroll: unused leave payout + gratuity (service-based) − outstanding loan clearance → final settlement payslip.

**Multi-Country** — Nigeria live; Ghana Q1 2027 (PAYE · SSNIT · Tier 2/3); Kenya Q3 2027 (PAYE · NSSF · SHIF). Framing line: *"Nigeria is the proving ground, not the ceiling."*

**Attendance** — weekly grid cycling Present → Late → Absent, explicitly tied to payroll deductions.

## 5. The 27-module feature map

The `featuremap` view enumerates every capability the platform is scoped to cover, grouped into 27 modules. Module names, in order:

Employee Management · Payroll Setup · Salary Structure · Earnings Management · Deductions · Attendance Integration · Leave Management · Overtime Management · Loans & Advances · Tax Management · Benefits Administration · Payroll Processing · Payslips · Direct Deposit & Payments · Expense Reimbursement · Compliance · Employee Self-Service · Manager Self-Service · Reporting & Analytics · Accounting Integration · Workflow & Approvals · Notifications · Security · Multi-Company & Global Payroll · Integrations · Final Settlement · Advanced Features

Roughly 230 individual line items across the 27. The view distinguishes "Live in this demo" from "Roadmap" — **note that the prototype currently flags all 27 as live, which overstates what is explorable.** Before showing this to an investor or client, set the flags honestly; an inflated feature map is the fastest way to lose credibility with a finance buyer who will click into things.

## 6. Integrations

**Bank disbursement** — bulk net-pay files generated automatically once a run is approved. Prototype shows GTBank and Access Bank connected, Zenith not connected.

**Accounting / ERP sync** — payroll journal entries posted after every processed run. QuickBooks and Sage connected, SAP via open API.

**Open APIs & webhooks** — keyed by scope: HRIS sync (employees, read/write), finance webhook (payroll runs, read-only), data warehouse export (compliance & reports, read-only).

All named vendors and connection states are demo fixtures. Real integration status must never be implied from them.

## 7. Brand voice

Confident, precise, institutional — a compliance firm's voice, not a startup's. Leans on inevitability and rigour rather than hype. The visual system (see `design-system.md`) does the same work: flat, dense, bordered, unshowy.

Signature phrasings to stay consistent with:

- "The compliance-native payroll platform for Nigeria and Africa."
- "Payroll should be **correct by construction**."
- "Compliance as the **core feature, not an afterthought** bolted onto generic payroll software."
- "Plutus turns that risk into a product."
- "Nigeria is the **proving ground, not the ceiling**."
- "Correct on day one, current for every reform that follows."
- "Each new country adds a statutory rule set, not a new platform."

Rules: cite the statutory framework precisely — it *is* the credibility. Never overclaim into tax or legal advice. Keep every number sourced from the statutory reference. Don't ship placeholder links. Don't describe roadmap capability in the present tense.

## 8. Investor brief structure

Canonical section order:

1. **Executive Summary** — the 2026 reform reset the landscape; Plutus is built on the new framework; raising to go Nigeria-first → West/East Africa.
2. **The Opportunity** — reform raised the *cost of getting it wrong*; payroll software becomes a compliance necessity, not a convenience.
3. **The Problem** — statutory complexity; a moving target; state-level fragmentation; multi-country ambition vs single-country tools.
4. **The Product** — three pillars (Payroll Core, Compliance Engine, People Operations).
5. **Nigeria Tax & Statutory Compliance Engine** — the differentiator; walk the seven schemes.
6. **Full Feature Set** — the module map, honestly flagged.
7. **Pan-African Expansion** — Ghana then Kenya; rules-layer-over-common-core argument.
8. **Business Model** — per-employee-per-month SaaS, tiered.
9. **The Ask** — three priorities over 18 months.
10. **Why Now, Why Us** — the reform is a rare market-wide trigger event; narrow window to become the default.

Footer treatment: "Plutus Technologies — Investor Brief — Confidential — [Month Year]".

**The Ask — three priorities (18 months):**

1. **Compliance depth** — complete state-by-state PAYE filing integrations; formalise direct remittance partnerships with PenCom-licensed PFAs, FMBN, NSITF, ITF.
2. **Go-to-market** — Lagos-based sales + customer success team to convert mid-market/enterprise off spreadsheets and legacy bureaus.
3. **Pan-African expansion** — stand up Ghana + Kenya statutory rule sets; launch with anchor multinational clients in both markets.

Funding amount, use-of-funds, and projections live in the data room — "available on request".

## 9. Problem framings

- **Statutory complexity** — seven distinct schemes, each with its own base, rate, remittance authority and deadline.
- **A moving target** — 2026 rewrote PAYE bands, replaced CRA with capped rent relief, made TIN mandatory; most tools haven't caught up.
- **State-level fragmentation** — 36 states + FCT each administer PAYE locally; multi-state workforces mean reconciling with multiple authorities every cycle.
- **Multi-country ambition, single-country tools** — expanding employers re-implement compliance from scratch per market, with no unified system of record.

## 10. Business model & moat

- **Pricing:** per-employee-per-month SaaS, tiered by feature depth (core payroll + compliance vs. full HR suite with self-service + multi-country).
- **Wedge:** compliance — the reason a finance leader can't afford spreadsheet payroll in 2026.
- **Moat:** encoded rules, once current, compound in value with every regulatory change absorbed on the client's behalf.
- **Why now:** the 2026 reform is the largest rewrite of Nigerian payroll compliance in a generation, forcing every employer to re-implement tax logic at the same moment — a rare, market-wide trigger event and a narrow window for a compliance-native product to become the default before employers standardise on the wrong tool.
